# typescript-shopping-cart

### Shopping carts are one of the most common things you will build as a web developer, but there is a lot that goes into building a good shopping cart. In this project I will build a fully functional shopping cart using

1. React, 
2. TypeScript, 
3. Bootstrap.

This is a great intermediate level project.
